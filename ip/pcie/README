The PCIe interface. Fundamentally this operates at the TLP level, but several extra layers of
logic have been added in pcie.vhdl and tlp_core.vhdl to provide a more user-friendly (if less
generic) interface to the outside world.

The pcie.qsys design was based on an Altera PCIe design example. I just did this:

cp $ALTERA/../ip/altera/altera_pcie/altera_pcie_hip_ast_ed/example_design/cv/pcie_de_gen1_x1_ast64.qsys pcie.qsys
$ALTERA/sopc_builder/bin/qsys-edit pcie.qsys

Then, in QSys:
  * Delete pcie_reconfig_driver_0 (i.e select it and hit <Del>).
  * Delete alt_xcvr_reconfig_0.
  * Right-click "DUT" and select "Edit".
  * Set VendorID: 0x1172 and DeviceID: 0xE001.
  * Click "Finish".
  * Click "File->Save".
  * Click "Close".
  * Click "File->Exit".
  * Click "No" (i.e don't generate now).
