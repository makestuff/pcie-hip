Low-level unit-test of tlp-core. This is the thing that translates the TLP interface provided by
pcie.vhdl into a (configurable) number of 32-bit CPU read/write channels, and a single FPGA->CPU
DMA pipe. In other words it's able to decode the incoming TLP packets coming over the bus from the
CPU, and it is able to compose suitable TLP packets to send back over the bus to the CPU.
